						<h2 class="blog-post-title">User guide and revisit logic bug</h2>
						<p class="blog-post-meta">2017-11-26 by hzck</p>
						<p>Since last update about a month ago there is two major updates:</p>
						<p>The first update is I just finished writing the <a href="/howto.html">User guide</a> section, which will hopefully help new users understand how to use the site and model their routes.</p>
						<p>The second update is a bug I stumbled upon in the algorithm itself, which prevented revisiting even though the model allowed for it.</p>
						<p>Looking forward I feel like I need to improve on the <a href="/route.html?g=DEMO">DEMO graph</a>, and I want to start looking into database support on the site.</p>

						<h2 class="blog-post-title">Presenting Speedroute</h2>
						<p class="blog-post-meta">2017-10-22 by hzck</p>
						<p>At last! After three years of on and off work I finally managed to put <a href="/">Speedroute</a> out there on the dangerous Internet. I'm still scared of what might happen and what kind of feedback I can expect, but at the same time I'm proud of what I have managed to achieve so far:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph is working (hopefully)</li>
							<li>The GUI covers all functionality needed (even if it's not intuitive...)</li>
							<li>Cloud hosting via <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a></li>
							<li>Full SSL encryption via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's encrypt</a></li>
							<li>Some content on the site, like this blog post and the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page</li>
						</ul>
						<p>There's still plenty to be done of course. I need to update the pages with content so that you will be able to use the site to the full extent, and so that you <em>want</em> to use it. I also want to look into database support soon which will be a great improvement and open up ways to implement cool functions on the site.</p>
						<p>I'll continue to work on Speedroute whenever I feel like it and I have time to spare. It's still a project I have a lot of interest in and I'm anxious to see how good it can get. Also it's a way for me to improve on my coding skills and try out new technologies and stuff like that.</p>
						<p>I hope you enjoy the site and don't be afraid to contact me if you have any issues or suggestions! You can find contact details on the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page.</p>
